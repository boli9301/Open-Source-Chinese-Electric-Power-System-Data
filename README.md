# Open-Source-Chinese-Electric-Power-System-Data

This repository is for the Open-Source Chinese Power System with High Spatial and Temporal Resolution, which is based on our works [1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9783435),[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030142152030673X),[3](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(21)01256-6),[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921016378).

This associated data has been developed for Chinese generation expansion planning which can be found in [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030142152030673X),[3](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(21)01256-6),[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921016378).

The [Data](https://github.com/boli9301/Open-Source-Chinese-Electric-Power-System-Data/tree/main/Data) folder contains data in an open `csv` format and visualization tool. Currently datasets are included in the following formats:
-[Power plant database of Guangxi] include fossil fuel generators, varaiable renewable energy generators in plant level.

The figure is a demonstrate of Open-Source Chinese Power System. The transmisison line information comes from [OpenStreetMap(OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/22.3567/114.1363) that is "free and editable map of the world". The installed capacity of coal, hydro, wind, solar, nuclear, and gas power plant in Guangxi by 2022 is 19.2GW, 21.8GW, 7.0GW, 3.2GW, 2GW, and 0.001GW, respectively.
